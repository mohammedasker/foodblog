# Gatsby blog with Netlify CMS

This project is an example of how to build a blog using Gatsby to quickly develop a fast web app and Netlify CMS for simple way to create and edit contents.

It is created as a part of the tutorial [How to Build a Blog with Gatsby and Netlify CMS – A Complete Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-blog-with-gatsby-and-netlify-cms/).

## Live demo

You can check the live demo right [here](https://gatsbyfoodblog.netlify.app/)

## To run on a local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/mohammedasker/foodblog.git
```

2. Change into the directory and install the dependencies

```
cd foodblog
yarn
```

3. Run the app locally. When it is fully started, you can view the site at `http://localhost:8000`

```
gatsby develop
```

To deploy the app, I'd recommend to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as it is relatively simple to use and it comes with many useful features.
